Two datasets have been used here:

2. Tweet data during the 2016 presidential election ('election_day_tweets.csv')

I have collectecd a seperate dataset through Twitty (API) between 01 Feb 2019 and 04 Feb 2019. 
It will be used to see the difference between tweets during election and normal time. It has been analyzed in the exploratory analysis. 
This dataset can be downloaded from here:
